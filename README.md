# Advanced Scavenger Hunt


## Overview
The beginning of first session should be allotted for icebreakers, expectations, and a company orientation. Students will then pair up to complete a [series of challenges](clues.md) that will test their skills on topics covered in ScriptEd year 1. 


## Project Extensions
There are plenty of challenges for this project, so students finishing early should not be an issue. It is likely no group will complete all the tasks.
