### Core Challenges
| #  | Name | Challenge | Example |
|:-------:|:-------:|------|------|
| 1 | jQuery | There's an error on the page.  What do we need to do before we can use jQuery? | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NIC0HKc.png">
| 2 | Boo | There's a click handler for the Boo button, but the alert is commented out.  Uncomment the alert so clicking the Boo button causes the alert "Boo". | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ipTkLde.gif"> |
| 3 | Show | Make it so clicking the "Show" button causes the image with the class "it-gif" to be visible.  You'll want to use the jQuery show method. |  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ObDORDP.gif"> |
| 4 | Hide |Make it so clicking the "Hide" button causes the image with the class "it-gif" to be hidden.  You'll want to use the jQuery hide method.  | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YKyxgXy.gif"> |
| 5 | Toggle | Make it so clicking the "Toggle" button causes the image with the class "it-gif" to switch between being visible and hidden.  You'll want to use the jQuery toggle method. | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PpFYNBu.gif"> |
| 6 | Text | Make it so clicking the "Text" button causes all the button elements to have the text "Boo" (or whatever text you'd like).  You'll want to use the jQuery text method. | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/smDWUVl.gif"> |
| 7 | CSS | Make it so clicking the "CSS" button causes all the h4 elements to have a color of orange.  You'll want to use the jQuery css method. | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/X0vV7b0.gif"> |
| 8 | Attribute | Make it so clicking the "Attr" button causes the image shown by exercise 3 to have the src equal to https://i.imgur.com/tn5ZVuP.gif.  You'll want to use the jQuery attr method. | <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7kyq4DE">Example</a> |
| 9 | Ghost | You may have noticed the addGhost function defined in the JavaScript section. Make it so clicking the "Ghost" button calls that function.  You should see another ghost flying around each time it's clicked. | <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1La9ebi">Example</a> |
| 10 | For Loop | You may have noticed the addGhost function defined in the JavaScript section. Make it so clicking the "For Loop" button calls that function 10 times (using a for loop).  You should see another 10 ghosts flying around each time it's clicked. | <a href="https://i.imgur.com/W1zJkxV">Example</a> |
| 11 | Curse | There's a click handler that gets called when the "Curse" button is clicked.  It has an empty array called "names" that is empty.  As a result, clicking the button causes a popup with the word "undefined".  Fill the array with at least 3 names so it will randomly show one of the names in the popup instead of "undefined" | <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gp8iMxI">Example</a> |
